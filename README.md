## About Me

Hello! I'm AstroWa3l. I love exploring how coding intersects with my passions, whether that's web development, data analysis, or any exciting project that pushes boundaries in technology and beyond. I enjoy continuously learning, sharing knowledge, and embarking on new adventures in coding.

## Programming Languages & Technologies

Here are some of the programming languages and technologies I actively use:
- **Python**: For data analysis, automation, and backend scripting.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building web applications and dynamic front-end experiences.
- **Go**: For building scalable and performant applications.
- **C++** (optional, if you use it regularly): For performance-critical tasks and systems programming.

Feel free to adjust this section with any other languages or frameworks you use!

## Projects & Interests

- **Web Development**: Building interactive and responsive sites or applications.  
- **Data Analysis & Machine Learning**: Exploring data with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.  
- **Crypto & Blockchain**: Exploring decentralized technologies and smart contracts.  
- **Automation & Tooling**: Creating scripts and tools to simplify workflows or handle repetitive tasks.
